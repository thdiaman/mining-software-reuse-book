### Chapter 9: Providing Reusability-aware Recommendations
This chapter includes the design of a Code Reuse system that accepts queries for
software components and recommends source code
that is assessed not only from a functional but also from a quality perspective.
The source code components are assessed for their reusability, i.e. the extent

### Chapter 10: Assessing the Reusability of Source Code Components
This chapter presents a methodology for assessing the reusability of source
code components by employing popularity and reuse information as ground truth.
