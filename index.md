This is a website accompanying the book:

<center style="padding-top:5px; padding-bottom:15px; font-size:125%">Mining Software Engineering Data for Software Reuse</center>

The book, which is currently in progress, is written by <a href="https://thdiaman.github.io">Themistoklis Diamantopoulos</a> and Andreas L. Symeonidis.

As such, this website currently offers only information about the contents of the book,
while later updated versions will also include supporting material.

The links to the left provide access to any supporting material (datasets, tools, etc.) for anyone that wishes
to reproduce the findings of the book.
